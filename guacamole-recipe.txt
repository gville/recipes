Ingredients:
 - 3 medium avocados or 4 small ones
 - 1 firm tomato, finely diced
 - 1/2 white onion
 - 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
 - 2 tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice
 - Optional salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
 1. Open the avocados and scoop out the flesh. An easy way is to cut it 
 	length-wise around the pit and than using a chefs knife strike the pit 
 	and then twist the knife so you can easily remove the pit and scoop out 
 	the flesh.
 
 2. Mash the flesh with a fork, it can still have hard parts, follow your 
 	preference.
 
 3. Stir the other ingredients.
